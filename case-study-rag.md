# RAG-based Internal Chatbot — Example

**Role:** PM & Technical collaborator
**Timeline:** Jan 2024 — Apr 2024

## Overview
Built a retrieval-augmented chatbot to accelerate internal ticket triage and reduce manual search time.

## Problem
Manual triage caused long MTTR and poor knowledge re-use.

## Approach
- Collected representative documents & FAQs
- Built embeddings + vector DB (FAISS/Pinecone) and an LLM for synthesis
- Iterated with human-in-loop feedback

## Outcome
- Automation rate: +X%
- MTTR reduced by Y%
- CSAT improved by Z points
