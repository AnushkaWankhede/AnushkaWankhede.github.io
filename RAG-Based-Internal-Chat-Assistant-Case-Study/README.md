## 🎯 Problem Statement

Khoros's support team was struggling with a fragmented knowledge management system that severely impacted productivity and customer satisfaction:

- 847 articles spread across 4 different platforms with poor searchability
- Agents spending average of 12 minutes searching per query with only 34% success rate
- Resolution time peaked at 6.4 hours during critical product launch
- CSAT dropped to 2.8/5 with increased customer churn
- Monthly productivity loss estimated at ₹2.3L

As the head of support put it: *"We're drowning in our own documentation."*

## 💡 My Solution Approach

Instead of forcing agents to hunt for answers, I developed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant that automatically surfaced relevant information:

- Data Archaeology & Consolidation
    - Manually reviewed entire knowledge base to identify 156 duplicate articles and outdated information
     Created canonical documents for each intent category with metadata tagging
     Retired 200+ outdated articles to streamline knowledge base
- Intelligence Layer Development
    - Built RAG pipeline using OpenAI embeddings and FAISS vector index
     Implemented confidence scoring with 0.7+ threshold for direct answers
     Created multiple fallback layers with human escalation paths
     Ensured source attribution for every answer to build trust
- User Experience Design
    - Developed agent-centric interface with one-click actions
     Added confidence indicators with color coding
     Included source links that opened in sidebar to prevent context switching
     A/B tested 12 prompt templates, finding structured responses performed 34% better

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

The project was executed in 8 weeks of focused development:

- Weeks 1-2: Foundation
    - Knowledge base audit and consolidation
     Creation of canonical documents with metadata
     Development of content architecture strategy
- Weeks 3-4: Intelligence Layer
    - Embedded 400 cleaned articles using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002
     Built FAISS vector index for sub-second retrieval
     Implemented confidence scoring and safety fallbacks
- Weeks 5-6: User Experience
    - Designed agent-centric interface
     Developed one-click action flows
     Created confidence indicators and source attribution system
- Weeks 7-8: Rollout & Iteration
    - Staged launch with 5 senior agents
     Full team rollout with daily pulse checks
     A/B testing of prompt templates and response formats

## 📚 Key Learnings

1. **Human Trust > Perfect Accuracy:** Adding confidence scores and source links increased adoption by 67%, even with slightly lower accuracy.
2. **Metadata Is Everything:** The quality of document tagging and categorization proved more important than the AI model itself.
3. **Change Management Matters:** Technical build took 6 weeks, but getting agents to adopt it required 4 weeks of training and iteration.

### Future Roadmap

The success of this implementation has led to an expanded vision:

- Integrate additional knowledge sources (Slack, release notes)
- Develop predictive insights for trending issues
- Implement self-learning loop based on resolution patterns
- Potential customer-facing implementation impacting 50,000+ users

**Key Takeaway:** Sometimes the most impactful products aren't new features—they're solutions that eliminate friction in existing workflows.
